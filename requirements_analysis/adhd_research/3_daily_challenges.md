# Daily Challenges for People with ADHD

🔙 [Back to ADHD Research Overview](./README.md)

## 🎯 Objective
Document the real-world daily struggles and challenges faced by people with ADHD to inform empathetic and effective app design.

## ⏰ Morning Challenges

### **Waking Up & Getting Started**
- **Sleep inertia**: Extreme difficulty waking up, hitting snooze repeatedly
- **Morning paralysis**: Knowing what needs to be done but unable to start
- **Decision fatigue**: What to wear, what to eat, what to do first
- **Time blindness**: Underestimating how long morning routines take

### **Example scenarios:**
- "I set 10 alarms and still end up late"
- "It takes me 2 hours to do what others do in 30 minutes"
- "I forget to eat breakfast or take medication"

## 🏠 Household & Personal Management

### **Organization & Cleaning**
- **Object permanence issues**: "Out of sight, out of mind" with belongings
- **Clutter accumulation**: Starting organizing but not finishing
- **Chores avoidance**: Dishes, laundry, cleaning feel overwhelming
- **Bill management**: Forgetting due dates, losing paperwork

### **Example scenarios:**
- "I buy duplicates because I can't find things"
- "My house is either spotless or a disaster, no in-between"
- "I have a 'doom pile' of important papers I'm avoiding"

## 💼 Work & Productivity Challenges

### **Focus & Task Management**
- **Task initiation**: "Wall of awful" preventing starting tasks
- **Sustained attention**: Drifting off during meetings or long tasks
- **Prioritization**: Everything feels equally urgent or unimportant
- **Transition difficulties**: Switching between tasks feels physically painful

### **Example scenarios:**
- "I work best at the last minute under pressure"
- "I start 5 projects and finish none"
- "I spend hours on unimportant tasks while critical ones wait"

## 🕒 Time Management & Planning

### **Time Perception Issues**
- **Time blindness**: Can't estimate how long tasks will take
- **Chronic lateness**: Despite best intentions and multiple alarms
- **Overcommitment**: Saying yes to everything, then overwhelmed
- **Deadline confusion**: Mixing up dates, times, locations

### **Example scenarios:**
- "I think something will take 30 minutes, it takes 3 hours"
- "I'm either 30 minutes early or 30 minutes late, never on time"
- "I double-book myself constantly"

## 👥 Social & Relationship Challenges

### **Communication & Interactions**
- **Conversation tracking**: Zoning out during conversations
- **Interrupting**: Speaking without waiting for turn
- **Forgetfulness**: Forgetting plans, birthdays, important dates
- **Rejection sensitivity**: Taking criticism or rejection extremely hard

### **Example scenarios:**
- "I forget plans with friends despite being excited about them"
- "People think I'm rude because I interrupt or space out"
- "I overanalyze every social interaction for hidden rejection"

## 🧠 Cognitive & Emotional Challenges

### **Executive Function Struggles**
- **Working memory**: Forgetting why you entered a room
- **Emotional regulation**: Quick to frustration, overwhelm, or excitement
- **Decision making**: Paralysis over simple choices
- **Follow-through**: Starting with enthusiasm, abandoning quickly

### **Example scenarios:**
- "I have 10 browser tabs open and 5 half-written emails"
- "Small setbacks feel like catastrophic failures"
- "I research for hours but can't make a simple decision"

## 💸 Financial Management

### **Money-Related Challenges**
- **Impulse spending**: Buying things without planning
- **Bill forgetting**: Late fees despite having money
- **Budgeting difficulties**: Can't track expenses consistently
- **Subscription traps**: Forgetting to cancel free trials

### **Example scenarios:**
- "I have subscriptions I don't use but forget to cancel"
- "I buy organizing systems to get organized, then don't use them"
- "I avoid checking my bank account because it's overwhelming"

## 📱 Technology & Digital Challenges

### **Digital Overwhelm**
- **Notification overload**: Can't manage email, messages, alerts
- **App hopping**: Downloading productivity apps but not sticking with any
- **Digital clutter**: Thousands of unorganized photos, files, emails
- **Doomscrolling**: Getting stuck in endless social media/Internet loops

### **Example scenarios:**
- "I have 15 to-do apps but still use sticky notes"
- "My inbox has 10,000+ unread emails"
- "I lose hours to random Internet research tangents"

## 🔄 The Vicious Cycles

### **Common ADHD Loops:**
1. **The Overwhelm Cycle**: Task feels big → Avoid it → Guilt builds → More avoidance
2. **The Hyperfocus Trap**: Get obsessed → Neglect everything else → Burnout → Crash
3. **The Perfectionism Paradox**: Want to do it perfectly → Can't start → Do nothing → Self-criticism
4. **The Compensation Spiral**: Develop complex systems → Can't maintain them → Feel like failure → Give up

## 🎯 App Design Implications

### **Addressing Core Challenges:**
- **Time blindness**: Visual time representations, realistic time estimators
- **Task initiation**: Micro-task breakdown, "just start" prompts
- **Object permanence**: Gentle reminders, visual cues
- **Overwhelm management**: Progressive disclosure, simplicity
- **Follow-through**: Celebration of small wins, progress tracking

### **Avoid Common Pitfalls:**
- ❌ Don't create another complex system to maintain
- ❌ Don't use shame or guilt-based notifications
- ❌ Don't require perfect consistency
- ❌ Don't add to decision fatigue
