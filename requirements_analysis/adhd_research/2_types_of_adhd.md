# ADHD Types & Profiles - Understanding the Variations

## 🔍 Official Diagnostic Types (DSM-5)
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition:

### 1. **Predominantly Inattentive Presentation**
Often called "ADD" (without hyperactivity)

#### **Core Characteristics:**
- **Attention**: Difficulty sustaining attention, easily distracted
- **Organization**: Poor organizational skills, messy workspaces
- **Follow-through**: Starts tasks but rarely finishes
- **Listening**: Seems not to listen when spoken to directly
- **Detail-oriented**: Makes careless mistakes, misses details
- **Forgetfulness**: Forgetful in daily activities

#### **Common Profile:**
- Often diagnosed later in life (especially women)
- May appear daydreamy or "spacey"
- Internal restlessness rather than physical hyperactivity
- Struggles with paperwork, admin tasks, long meetings

### 2. **Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation**

#### **Core Characteristics:**
- **Hyperactivity**: Fidgeting, tapping, inability to stay seated
- **Restlessness**: Feeling "on the go" constantly
- **Quiet activities**: Difficulty engaging in quiet leisure
- **Talking**: Excessive talking, finishing others' sentences
- **Impulsivity**: Blurting answers, difficulty waiting turn
- **Interrupting**: Intrudes on others' conversations/activities

#### **Common Profile:**
- More noticeable in childhood
- Often gets "in trouble" for behavior
- May be perceived as "too much" or "intense"
- Physical energy needs an outlet

### 3. **Combined Presentation**
Has both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms

#### **Core Characteristics:**
- Meets criteria for both types above
- Most common diagnosis in children
- Can shift between presentations over time

## 🎭 Beyond the DSM: Real-World ADHD Profiles

### **The "Hyperfocus" Paradox**
Many with ADHD experience periods of intense concentration on interesting tasks:
- Can work for hours on passion projects
- May forget to eat, sleep, or use bathroom
- Followed by complete burnout/exhaustion
- **App implication**: Need balance features, not just focus tools

### **The "Masking" Phenomenon**
Especially common in women and high-achievers:
- Developing coping strategies to hide symptoms
- Extreme organization to compensate
- People-pleasing to avoid criticism
- Burning out from constant effort
- **App implication**: Address root issues, not just surface symptoms

### **The "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria" (RSD) Profile**
Not official but widely reported:
- Extreme emotional sensitivity to rejection/criticism
- May avoid situations where failure is possible
- Perfectionism as protection mechanism
- **App implication**: Gentle feedback systems, no shame-based reminders

### **The "Time Blindness" Profile**
- Severe difficulty estimating time
- Chronic lateness despite best intentions
- Either underestimating or overestimating task duration
- **App implication**: Visual time aids, realistic time estimation help

### **The "Executive Dysfunction" Profile**
Struggles specifically with executive functions:
- Task initiation ("wall of awful")
- Working memory (holding information)
- Cognitive flexibility (switching tasks)
- Emotional regulation
- **App implication**: Break tasks into microscopic steps

## 👥 Gender & Age Differences

### **Women with ADHD**
- Often inattentive type, diagnosed later
- Internalized symptoms (anxiety, depression)
- Better at masking/coping
- May be misdiagnosed with mood disorders

### **Men with ADHD**
- More likely hyperactive/combined type
- Diagnosed earlier due to disruptive behavior
- May exhibit more externalizing behaviors

### **Adult vs. Child Presentation**
- **Children**: More obvious hyperactivity
- **Adults**: Hyperactivity internalizes (restlessness, racing thoughts)
- **Aging**: Symptoms may change but don't disappear

## 🧩 Co-occurring Conditions (Comorbidities)
ADHD rarely exists alone:

| Condition | Connection to ADHD |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Anxiety** | Constant worry about forgetting, underperforming |
| **Depression** | From chronic underachievement, criticism |
| **Learning Disabilities** | Dyslexia, dyscalculia often co-occur |
| **Autism** | Shared executive function challenges |
| **Sleep Disorders** | Racing thoughts at night, irregular sleep |
| **Substance Use** | Self-medication attempts |

## 🎯 App Design Implications for Different Profiles

### **For Dodson's 4 Temperaments:**
- **Dreamers**: Mind mapping tools, visual organizers, gentle notifications
- **Hyper-talkative**: Voice input, quick capture, movement integration
- **Over-focused**: Transition prompts, flexibility exercises, time boxing
- **Combined/Emotional**: Mood tracking, emotional regulation aids, positive reinforceme

### **For Inattentive Type:**
- External memory aids (reminders, checklists)
- Distraction blockers
- Task breakdown tools

### **For Hyperactive Type:**
- Movement integration (pomodoro with stretch breaks)
- Energy channeling features
- Quick capture for racing thoughts

### **For Combined Type:**
- Flexible system accommodating both needs
- Customizable interface
- Multiple ways to interact

### **For All Types:**
- No shame-based design
- Accommodating bad days
- Celebrating small wins
