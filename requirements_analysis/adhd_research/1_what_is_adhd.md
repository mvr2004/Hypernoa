# What is ADHD? - Basic Overview

## 📋 Definition
**ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)** is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects a person's ability to regulate attention, control impulses, and manage activity levels.

## 🔬 Scientific Basis - Why It Happens
ADHD has biological origins in brain structure and function:

### **Brain Structure Differences**
- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Smaller volume and reduced activity - affects executive functions (planning, decision-making)
- **Basal Ganglia**: Differences in size and function - impacts reward processing and motivation
- **Cerebellum**: Smaller in some individuals - affects timing and coordination

### **Neurochemical Factors**
- **Dopamine Dysregulation**: Lower dopamine availability affects reward motivation and attention
- **Norepinephrine Imbalance**: Impacts alertness, arousal, and stress response
- **Neurotransmitter Transport**: Altered dopamine transporter density affects signal duration

### **Genetic Components**
- **High Heritability**: 70-80% genetic influence
- **Multiple Genes**: Involved in dopamine regulation and neural development
- **Family Patterns**: Often runs in families

### **Neurological Networks**
- **Default Mode Network**: Overactive - leads to mind-wandering and distraction
- **Executive Control Network**: Underactive - difficulty with focus and inhibition
- **Salience Network**: Altered - trouble filtering important vs. unimportant stimuli

## 🔢 The Two Main Types
While ADHD presentations vary, they generally fall into two main patterns:

1. **Attention Difficulties** - Trouble focusing, staying organized, following through
2. **Hyperactivity/Impulsivity** - Restlessness, acting without thinking, constant movement

*Note: We'll explore these types in detail in a separate document.*

## 🎯 Common Daily Challenges
People with ADHD often experience:

### **Focus & Attention**
- Starting tasks but not finishing them
- Getting easily distracted
- "Zoning out" during conversations
- Difficulty with boring or repetitive tasks

### **Organization & Memory**
- Frequently losing important items (keys, phone, documents)
- Forgetting appointments or deadlines
- Struggling to organize tasks and priorities
- Messy workspaces despite wanting order

### **Time Management**
- Chronic lateness or poor time estimation
- Procrastinating until the last minute
- Underestimating how long tasks will take
- Difficulty breaking projects into steps

### **Emotional Regulation**
- Feeling overwhelmed easily
- Frustration with own limitations
- Emotional sensitivity
- Impulsive reactions

### **Daily Life Impact**
- Work/school underperformance compared to ability
- Strained relationships due to forgetfulness
- Financial disorganization (late bills, impulsive spending)
- Self-esteem issues from repeated struggles

## 📚 Sources & Research Basis
This information comes from:

### **Academic & Clinical Sources**
1. **DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual)** - Standard diagnostic criteria
2. **CHADD (Children and Adults with ADHD)** - Leading ADHD organization
3. **Russell Barkley's research** - Prominent ADHD researcher
4. **Neuroimaging Studies** - MRI/fMRI research on brain differences

## 🎨 Why This Matters for Our App
Understanding the science helps us build better tools:
- **Brain-based design** - Creating features that work with ADHD neurology
- **Targeting real mechanisms** - Addressing dopamine motivation systems, executive function support
- **Evidence-based approach** - Not just assumptions, but scientifically-informed solutions
- **Empathetic design** - Understanding these are brain differences, not character flaws
