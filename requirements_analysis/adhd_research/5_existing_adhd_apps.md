## Key Market Gaps Identified:

### ❌ **Missing in Current Market:**
1. **Truly flexible systems** that adapt to good/bad ADHD days
2. **Affordable** ADHD-specific tools (most are expensive subscriptions)
3. **Cross-platform** ADHD apps with full feature parity
4. **Apps that understand emotional component** (RSD, shame cycles)
5. **Tools that prevent hyperfocus burnout** (most only encourage focus)

### ✅ **Opportunities for Our App:**
1. **Adaptive difficulty** - Easier on bad days, more features on good days
2. **Emotion-aware design** - No shame, no guilt, only encouragement
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
4. **Community features** - Optional, not mandatory
5. **One-time purchase option** - Not just subscriptions

## Design Patterns That Work for ADHD:

### **Effective Patterns:**
- **Visual over textual** - Icons, colors, timelines
- **Immediate feedback** - Quick rewards for small actions
- **Low barrier to entry** - Start using in under 60 seconds
- **Forgiving design** - Miss a day? No problem, start fresh
- **Customizable notifications** - Gentle, encouraging, never nagging

### **Ineffective Patterns (Common in Competitors):**
- ❌ **Complex onboarding** - Lose users before they start
- ❌ **Perfection tracking** - Streaks that break and cause abandonment
- ❌ **Information overload** - Too many options upfront
- ❌ **Rigid systems** - No accommodation for ADHD variability
- ❌ **Shame-based messaging** - "You failed your streak!"

3. **Price point**: $2-4/month or $30-50 lifetime
