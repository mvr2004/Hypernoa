🔙 [Back to ADHD Research Overview](./README.md)

## 🎯 Objective
Document effective strategies, techniques, and workarounds that people with ADHD use to manage daily challenges. This informs what features to include (or avoid) in our app.

## 🧠 Mindset & Psychological Strategies

### **Self-Acceptance & Reframing**
- **ADHD as different wiring, not defect**: Embracing neurodiversity
- **Progress over perfection**: Celebrating small wins
- **The "good enough" principle**: Avoiding perfectionism paralysis
- **Self-compassion**: Talking to oneself like a good friend

### **Externalizing Executive Functions**
- **Brain dumping**: Writing everything down to clear mental RAM
- **External memory**: Using notes, lists, calendars as "external brain"
- **Visual reminders**: Placing items in line of sight
- **Accountability partners**: Social pressure to follow through

## ⏰ Time Management Strategies

### **For Time Blindness**
- **Time timers**: Visual clocks showing elapsed time
- **Pomodoro technique**: 25-min focus, 5-min break (adjusted for ADHD)
- **Time blocking**: Assigning specific times for specific tasks
- **Buffer time**: Adding 50% extra time to all estimates
- **Backward planning**: Starting from deadline and working backward

### **For Procrastination**
- **The 5-second rule**: Count 5-4-3-2-1 and just start
- **Micro-tasks**: Breaking tasks into 5-minute chunks
- **Body doubling**: Working alongside someone (even virtually)
- **Accountability declarations**: Telling others what you'll do

## 📋 Organization & Task Management

### **Task Management Systems**
- **Bullet journal**: Flexible analog system popular in ADHD community
- **GTD (Getting Things Done)**: Modified for ADHD (simplified)
- **Kanban boards**: Visual workflow (To Do, Doing, Done)
- **Priority matrix**: Urgent vs. Important categorization

### **For Task Initiation**
- **"Just open the document"**: Lowering the barrier to start
- **"Do the worst first"**: Tackling hardest task when energy is highest
- **Habit stacking**: Attaching new habits to existing ones
- **Reward systems**: Immediate rewards for task completion

## 🏠 Environmental Modifications

### **Reducing Distractions**
- **Designated spaces**: Specific places for specific activities
- **Minimalist environments**: Fewer items = fewer distractions
- **White noise/background sounds**: For concentration
- **Phone graveyards**: Putting phone in another room

### **Increasing Cues**
- **Visual prompts**: Leaving items where you'll see them
- **Checklist at point of performance**: Instructions where needed
- **Smart home automation**: Lights, reminders, routines
- **"Out of sight, out of mind" reversal**: Making important things visible

## 💭 Cognitive & Behavioral Techniques

### **For Emotional Regulation**
- **RAIN technique**: Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Nurture
- **Emotion labeling**: "Naming it to tame it"
- **Mindfulness practices**: Short, ADHD-friendly meditations
- **Diversion activities**: Healthy distractions during emotional spikes

### **For Decision Making**
- **Decision deadlines**: "I'll decide by 3 PM today"
- **Pros/cons lists**: Visual decision aids
- **"Good enough" criteria**: Setting minimum viable choice standards
- **Asking for input**: Crowdsourcing decisions when stuck

## 📱 Technology & Tool Strategies

### **Digital Tools That Work**
- **Voice assistants**: For quick capture and reminders
- **Note-taking apps**: With good search and organization
- **Focus apps**: That block distractions but allow emergencies
- **Habit trackers**: With gentle, non-shaming design

### **Avoiding Digital Pitfalls**
- **App minimalism**: Using fewer tools consistently
- **Notification curation**: Aggressive filtering of alerts
- **Scheduled doomscrolling**: Allowing limited time for distractions
- **Digital detox periods**: Scheduled offline time

## 👥 Social & Relationship Strategies

### **Communication Techniques**
- **Note-taking during conversations**: For remembering details
- **"Let me think about that"**: Buying time for decisions
- **Pre-written scripts**: For difficult conversations
- **Asking for written instructions**: When verbal isn't retained

### **Managing Relationships**
- **Shared calendars**: With partners/family
- **Regular check-ins**: Preventing issues from accumulating
- **ADHD education for loved ones**: Helping others understand
- **Specific ask vs. general help**: "Please put dishes away" vs. "Please help"

## 🔄 What Makes Strategies ADHD-Friendly?

### **Effective Strategy Characteristics:**
- **Immediate feedback**: Quick rewards or progress indicators
- **Low barrier to entry**: Easy to start, no complex setup
- **Flexible, not rigid**: Can adapt to good/bad days
- **Visual and tangible**: Not just abstract concepts
- **Built-in accountability**: Social or automated check-ins
- **Forgiving design**: Allows for misses without complete failure

### **Ineffective Strategy Patterns:**
- ❌ **Overly complex systems**: Require more executive function than they save
- ❌ **Perfection-requiring**: All-or-nothing approaches
- ❌ **Shame-based**: Using guilt as motivation
- ❌ **Inflexible routines**: No accommodation for ADHD variability
- ❌ **Solo reliance**: Requiring constant self-discipline

## 🎯 App Design Implications

### **Features to Include:**
- **Micro-task breakdown**: Automatic task decomposition
- **Visual time representation**: Time timers, progress bars
- **Gentle reminders**: Non-intrusive, non-shaming notifications
- **Progress celebration**: Recognition of small accomplishments
- **Flexible systems**: That adapt to user's current capacity
- **Social features**: Optional accountability and body doubling

### **Features to Avoid:**
