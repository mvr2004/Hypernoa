## 🧠 **Executive Function Support**

### **Task Initiation & Breakdown**
1. **As Alex** (startup founder with task paralysis),
   **I want** large projects automatically broken into 15-minute micro-tasks,
   **so that** I can overcome the "wall of awful" and just start.

2. **As Elena** (scientist with rabbit-hole tendency),
   **I want** the app to suggest closing irrelevant browser tabs during focus sessions,
   **so that** I stay on track with grant writing instead of researching tangents.

3. **As Carlos** (farmer with constant interruptions),
   **I want** the schedule to automatically add buffer time for unexpected emergencies,
   **so that** tractor breakdowns don't ruin my entire day's plan.

### **Time Management & Estimation**
4. **As Marcus** (student with time blindness),
   **I want** to see a visual countdown timer during 4-hour lectures,
   **so that** I can manage my restlessness and maintain focus in chunks.

5. **As Isabella** (teacher grading 120 papers),
   **I want** the app to estimate how long batches will take based on my past speed,
   **so that** I can plan my weekend realistically and avoid Sunday panic.

6. **As David** (construction manager switching sites),

   **so that** I don't underestimate how long site visits actually take.

## 😔 **Emotional & Psychological Support**

### **Rejection Sensitivity & Anxiety**
7. **As Sophie** (illustrator with RSD),
   **I want** email drafts checked for self-critical language before sending,
   **so that** client communications don't trigger my rejection sensitivity.

8. **As Aisha** (lawyer with perfectionism),
   **I want** the app to tell me when my work is "good enough to submit",
   **so that** I don't waste hours over-polishing billable hour reports.

9. **As Robert** (newly diagnosed retiree),
   **I want** positive reinforcement for small consistency wins,
   **so that** I don't feel defeated when I miss one medication dose.

### **Motivation & Reward**
10. **As all personas** on bad ADHD days,
    **I want** an "easy mode" with simplified interfaces and reduced expectations,
    **so that** I can still use the app instead of abandoning it completely.

11. **As Marcus** during study marathons,
    **I want** scheduled movement breaks with simple exercise suggestions,
    **so that** I can release physical restlessness without losing study momentum.

## 👥 **Social & Family Coordination**

### **Shared Responsibilities**
12. **As Tom & Sarah** (ADHD parents),
    **I want** a family hub where medication doses are logged and visible to both parents,
    **so that** we never double-dose or miss our children's medications.

13. **As the Chen family** during school mornings,
    **I want** location-based checklists that trigger when leaving the house,
    **so that** lunchboxes, homework, and backpacks don't get forgotten.

14. **As David** coordinating with 8 subcontractors,
    **I want** to share specific checklist items with crew members via simple links,
    **so that** everyone knows their responsibilities without lengthy meetings.

### **Accountability & Support**
15. **As Alex** preparing investor pitches,
    **I want** optional accountability check-ins with my co-founder,
    **so that** I have social pressure to make progress without micromanagement.

16. **As Sophie** working solo from home,
    **I want** virtual "body doubling" sessions scheduled in the app,
    **so that** I have company during lonely work hours to maintain momentum.

## 📱 **Technical & Accessibility**

### **Interface & Usability**
17. **As David** (low tech comfort, works with dirty hands),
    **I want** voice-to-text input for all note-taking on construction sites,
    **so that** I can capture information without touching my phone with muddy gloves.

18. **As Robert** (older user, new to ADHD apps),
    **I want** large buttons, simple navigation, and clear tutorials,
    **so that** I can use the app without feeling overwhelmed by technology.

19. **As Carlos** working in areas with poor reception,
    **I want** full offline functionality that syncs when I'm back at the farmhouse,
    **so that** I can use the app anywhere on my property.

### **Integration & Flexibility**
20. **As Aisha** (uses legal-specific software),
    **I want** the app to integrate with my existing billing software,
    **so that** I don't have to switch between multiple disconnected systems.

21. **As Elena** with 15+ browser tabs open,
    **I want** the app to suggest relevant research based on my current writing topic,
    **so that** helpful resources are surfaced without me going searching.

22. **As Isabella** (color-coded everything),
    **I want** customizable color schemes for different task types and priorities,
    **so that** I can maintain my existing organizational system digitally.

## 💊 **Health & Wellness Integration**

### **Medication Management**
23. **As Marcus** on stimulant medication,
    **I want** the app to remind me to eat meals when my medication suppresses appetite,
    **so that** I maintain energy levels and avoid crashes.

24. **As Sophie** trying behavioral strategies instead of medication,
    **I want** to track which coping techniques work best for different challenges,
    **so that** I can build my personalized ADHD management toolkit.

25. **As the Chen family** managing 4 different medication schedules,
    **I want** a visual medication tracker with refill reminders,
    **so that** we never run out of crucial prescriptions.

### **Sleep & Routine**
26. **As Alex** working until 4 AM before investor meetings,
    **I want** the app to enforce a "wind down" routine before bed,
    **so that** I get adequate sleep despite deadline pressure.

27. **As Robert** adjusting to retirement structure loss,
    **I want** suggested daily routines based on successful retired ADHDers,
    **so that** I maintain purpose and structure without a 9-5 job.
